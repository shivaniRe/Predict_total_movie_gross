# Project-Luther
From information that is easily available about movies, we can infer that opening weekend gross and critics reviews have a high effect on the total gross of a movie. Once a movie is released the features that donâ€™t change are budget, release date and genre of a movie.

With my data I built multiple models using different features to compare models and pick the most appropriate features for my prediction.
